            The Christian Missions Charitable Trust (CMCT) was established in
            1964 by Dr. Colleen Redit, aiming to support disadvantaged young
            women in attaining financial independence and self-sufficiency.
            Since its inception, CMCT has evolved into a comprehensive
            charitable organization impacting numerous lives. Our initiatives
            are closely aligned with seven out of the eight Millennium
            Development Goals.Education and training are integral components of
            nearly every CMCT initiative. We firmly believe that empowering
            vulnerable individuals with new skills enables them to break free
            from poverty and maintain their autonomy. Regardless of caste,
            creed, or religious affiliation, we extend our services to those in
            need.CMCT operates independently of government funding, relying
            primarily on the generosity of individual donors like yourself.

            serving our beneficiaries with integrity and dedication.
